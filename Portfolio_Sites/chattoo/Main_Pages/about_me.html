<h2 class="top">PERSONAL
BACKGROUND
AND
IDEALS</h2>
<p class="top">I am
Indian-American and lived in Queens for over 30 years, which has
allowed me to learn about so many diverse cultures and various
backgrounds. I was fortunate enough to have loving parents who
instilled in me the value of education, and they poured their life and
soul into me to make me the
man I am today. I became a mental health
professional and educator to give back to my community the same
way in
which I was nourished. My goal is to make a difference
in
teenager&rsquo;s lives, and I want to make this city a better place
than which I found it. </p>
<p>As an American from a South
Asian background, I can relate to a wide and diverse group of people. I
find that many common issues underlie almost all different groups. Life
brings on many challenges, and I am here to help you to meet and deal
with these challenges. I ams a practical, interactive, solution-focused
professional whose treatment approach is to provide support and
practical feedback to help clients resolve current problems and
long-standing patterns. With sensitivity and compassion, I help clients
find solutions to those problems and patterns. Blending conventional
and alternative approaches, I draw on a variety of styles and
techniques to incorporate what will be most helpful for each client. I
work with each client to help build on his or her strengths to identify
and achieve life goals. </p>
