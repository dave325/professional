            <h2>PERSONAL BACKGROUND 
      AND IDEALS</h2>
      <p class="content">I am Indian-American and lived in Queens for over 30 years,  which has allowed me to learn about so many diverse cultures and various  backgrounds. I was fortunate enough to have loving parents who instilled in me  the value of education, and they poured their life and soul into me to make me  the man I am today. I became a mental health professional and educator to give  back to my community the same way in which I was nourished. My goal is to make  a difference in teenager&rsquo;s lives and I want to make this city a better place  than which I found it. </p>
      <p class="content">Being an American from South Asian backgrounds I can relate  to a wide and diverse group of people. I find that many common issues underlie  almost all different groups. Life brings on many challenges, and I am here to  help you to meet and deal with these challenges. I am a practical, interactive,  solution-focused professional whose treatment approach is to provide support  and practical feedback to help clients resolve current problems and  long-standing patterns. With sensitivity and compassion, I help clients find  solutions to those problems and patterns. Blending conventional and alternative  approaches, I draw on a variety of styles and techniques to incorporate what  will be most helpful for each client. I work with each client to help build on  his or her strengths to identify and achieve life goals. </p>
