                    <p>
                        Stress is perfectly normal. It is just a sense of
                        danger - real or imaginary - that kicks your body's
                        defenses into high gear, also known as "fight or
                        flight" or the stress response. It is a big difference
                        between being stressed and overly stresses. Stress has
                        a positive effect on your body. It helps you stay
                        energetic, focused, and alert. In certain situations it
                        can save your life, and can sharpen your concentration
                        and drives you to do what is more important. Being
                        overly stressed can cause major damage to many areas
                        such as:

                        It is no surprise that college can be extremely
                        stressful on an individual. College students are made
                        to adjust to an independent life, learning to balance
                        their social, work and academic life. College students
                        are constantly given deadlines for assignments,
                        projects, midterms, finals, etc.. Contrary to popular
                        belief, stress is not only caused by negative life
                        events such as strict deadlines, arguments etc.. but
                        can be caused by positive events such as clubs,
                        graduating etc..

                        A common term many individuals either hear or use is

                        The human body sends a signal to the brain giving it a
                        warning signal that you are in danger, "beginning with
                        the release of the hormone ACTH into the bloodstream.
                        Within seconds, there is the output of adrenalin and
                        other stress-related hormones, a rise in blood
                        pressure, an increase in glucose levels and the
                        alerting of the major organs and sensory systems to
                        prepare for physical action."
