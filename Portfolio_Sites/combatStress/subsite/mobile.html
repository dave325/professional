                        Stress is perfectly normal. It is just a sense of

                        flight" or the stress response. It is a big difference
                        between being stressed and overly stresses. Stress has
                        a positive effect on your body. It helps you stay
                        energetic, focused, and alert. In certain situations it
                        can save your life, and can sharpen your concentration
                        and drives you to do what is more important. Being
                        overly stressed can cause major damage to many areas
                        such as:

                        It is no surprise that college can be extremely
                        stressful on an individual. College students are made
                        to adjust to an independent life, learning to balance
                        their social, work and academic life. College students
                        are constantly given deadlines for assignments,
                        projects, midterms, finals, etc.. Contrary to popular
                        belief, stress is not only caused by negative life
                        events such as strict deadlines, arguments etc.. but
                        can be caused by positive events such as clubs,
                        graduating etc..

                    Being aware of stressful situations is the key component
                    to managing stress. An effective way of monitoring and
                    understanding where your stress comes from is by using a
                    journal/diary. By keeping a record of your stressors you
                    can have a better understanding of how you react to
                    situations you are in.

                    <li>Set realistic, clear goals and prioritize your time.
                        Evaluate goals periodically, and have the flexibility to
                        modify them when appropriate. Many college students take
                        on too many activities without considering which ones are
                        truly important and/or rewarding. If you find yourself
                        overly stressed, consider letting go of some of your
                        activities that you are only doing because you feel you
                        "should."

                    <li>Deal with both success and failure with a balanced
                        attitude. Recognize that disappointing/negative
                        experiences are a natural part of the cycles of life. Use
                        crises as opportunities for growth, and to reaffirm
                        values and break unhealthy patterns.
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't drift along in troublesome or
                        emotionally draining relationships or situations. Take
                        steps to resolve the problems, or consider ending the
                        relationship or experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make time to be with significant others in
                        relationships that are trusting and reciprocal, and that
                        leave you feeling energized.
                    </li>
                    <li>Find time every day for some form of relaxation or
                        fun, such as watching your favorite show, exercising,
                        laughing with a friend, or spending needed time alone.
